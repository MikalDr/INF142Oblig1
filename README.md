# DISCLAIMER
- The usernames which are assigned are auto-generated, and only for that session (Like in Google docs);
It should not be a breach of the anonymity criteria. 

# How to run
1. Start the server, using: python RAPServer.py
2. Start one or multiple clients, using python RAPClient.py
  - If there are no Advisee's they are assigned that roel
  - If there are Advisees the role selection is random, so one can end
  up with multiple Advisors, but a single advisee.
3. When a client is started, the terminal should give insctructions for the use of the application.

The Server and Client works with the condition that there are no unexpected disconnects or errors.
